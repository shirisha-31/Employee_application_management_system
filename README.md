# Employee Application Management System

🔍 About the Project

The Employee Record Management System is a dynamic web application developed using Spring Boot to streamline the management of employee information within an organization. The system enables efficient handling of employee data through structured layers and database integration.

It is designed following enterprise-level development practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean code organization.





## 🎯 Core Functionalities

1)Add new employee details

2)View all employees in a tabular format

3)Update existing employee information

4)Delete employee records

5)User-friendly UI using JSP and Bootstrap

6)Data persistence using a relational database



## 🏛️ Design Approach


The application is structured using a multi-layered architecture to maintain separation of responsibilities:

›Presentation Layer (Controller)
Manages incoming client requests and directs them to appropriate services.

›Business Layer (Service)
Processes application logic and validates operations before interacting with data.

›Persistence Layer (Repository/DAO)
Handles communication with the database using Spring Data JPA.

›Database Layer
Stores employee-related information securely in MySQL.




## Architecture Flow:

Client Request → Controller → Service → Repository → MySQL Database




 ##  📦 Application Components





###  🔹 Employee Model

Represents the employee entity and maps it to a database table using JPA.
Includes attributes such as:

›Employee ID

›First Name

›Last Name

›Email Address

›Department



### 🔹 Controller Component

Responsible for:

›Fetching employee lists

›Handling form submissions

›Updating employee details

›Processing delete operations



### 🔹 Service Component

›Implements business rules and acts as an intermediary between controller and repository.



### 🔹 Repository Component

›Leverages Spring Data JPA to perform CRUD operations without manually writing SQL queries.
